# KSP-Patches
A collection of patches used in my gameplay

IMPORTANT!<br>
* The values of life support are adjusted in the <a href="https://github.com/Wallum/KSP-Patches/blob/main/GameData/Wallum/WallumConfig.cfg">WallumConfig.cfg</a> file. Please adjust this as necessary for your Kerbalism profile, based on how much resources are used in a day.<br>
* I have also specifically remove the configurable unmanned experiments as visible in the <a href="https://github.com/Wallum/KSP-Patches/blob/main/GameData/Wallum/KerbalismConfig/Fixes.cfg">KerbalismConfig/Fixes.cfg</a> file. If you would NOT like them deleted, please remove lines 10-21.
